# Python101

## Chapter-1
1. Intro to Python

2. Module - Its a file containing code that can be shared among programers.

There a 2 types of module - builtin and external(can be installed using pip)


3. Pip - Its package manager for python.

4. REPL - Its python terminal that we get when we type python + enter

5. Comments - can be added as info in python file using #(single line) and '''(for multiline)

## Chapter-1 Practice set
1. write a program to print a peom - 11_PS.py
2. use REPL to print table of 5 - ![alt text](image-1.png)
3. use and external module - 12_PS.py - ![alt text](image-2.png)
4. use a func from os module to print content of a dir - 13_PS.py
5. use comment is 4 - 13_PS.py


## Chapter-2

1. Variables - containers to store values(can only start with character or undescore)

2. Keywords - some words are reserved in python and should not be used as variables. like import, def , etc.

3. Use of built in function type() - to check type of variable

4. Operators - used to carry out operations

Arithmatic -, +, *, /

Assigment  +=, -=, *=, /=

Comparison ==, >=, <=, <, > (prints boolean results)

Logical and, or, not ( works on boolean value) 
and- returns true when both are true
or- returns true when any one is true
not- returns the opposite

5. Typecasting - used to chnage data-type of variable.(only for valid conversions)

6. Input function - used to take input from user(assumes input as string only)

## Chapter-2 Practice set
1. program to add 2 numbers - 21_PS.py
2. find remainder when a number is divided by 2 = 21_PS.py
3. Check type of variable = 23_PS.py
4. use comparison op to find where a=34 is bigger that b=90 or not - 24_PS.py
5. program to find average of two numbers entered by user - 25_PS.py
6. program to find square of two numbers entered by user - 26_PS.py

## Chapter-3

1. Strings - Its a datatype.

Single Quoted - 'Saif' or 'Saif "WoW"'

Double Quoted - "Saif's Bike" (used when we have single quote in the sentence)

Triple Quoted - '''Saif's Bike is new.
                He is riding is bike today''' (used when we have single and double quote or new line in the sentence)

2. String concatenation - + can be used to do that

3. String Slicing - Slicing a string in python to get values suing indexes

4. String Fuctions - All important functions for string

5. Excape Sequences - \n - newline, \t - tab, \' - single quote, \\ - backslash


## Chapter-3 Practice set
1. prog to add Good Afternoon to a user entered input
2. fill a letter template
3. prog to detect double space in string
4. replace it with single string from 3
5. use escape sequence - "Dear Saif, Can you please help \"me\". Thanks!"
